Deep Learning project, classify and predict Alzheimer disease from MRI Images.

The idea of the project is to develop an inclusive algorithm for detection, recognition and prediction of the presence of a dementia disease such as alzheimer's through statistical-historical data from a patients dataframe and MRI images.

Nowadays, the project sees the development of the statistical analysis part of the historical data in search of the best correlations in order to develop a model to be implemented with appropriate image analysis with CNN and image segmentation.
