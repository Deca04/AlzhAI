## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an inclusive algorithm for the detection, recognition, and prediction of Alzheimer's disease through the integration of statistical-historical data and MRI images. The goal is to create a reliable model that can assist in the early diagnosis and prediction of dementia-related diseases such as Alzheimer's.

## Project Structure
   ### 1. Statistical Analysis of Historical Data
   The first phase of the project focuses on the statistical analysis of historical data from patient records. This includes:

   * Data Collection: Gathering patient data, including demographics, medical history, and other relevant features.
   * Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data to ensure quality and consistency.
   * Correlation Analysis: Identifying key features that have the highest correlation with the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
   * Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features to be used in the predictive model.

   ### 2. Development of Predictive Model
   After identifying the key correlations from the historical data, the next step involves:

   * Model Design: Developing a predictive model using Tensorflow, a basic model is enough considering the work is on a binary decision.
   * Model Training: Training the model with the processed historical data to optimize its accuracy.
